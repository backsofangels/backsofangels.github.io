      <h3>Who am I</h3>
      <p>
        Software engineer by day, currently working in the banking sector for a mobile banking team. 
        At night, I like to play around to bring my ideas to life, whether it is to 
        keep my trusted RaspberryPi up and running with its containers, 
        or to develop stuff which is mainly useless but helps me learn stuff.

      <h3>Under the hood</h3>
      <p>
        Not only a techie, I've also lots of other passions! I like to play video games a lot, League of Legends has been a really bad rabbit hole for me in the past.
        Same goes for TTRPGs, I've played D&D for like 10+ years. Also, I like playing guitar even though I don't play as much as I used to do in the past.
        Then, I love photography and photo editing, so don't be surprised if you will see here some travel posts with pictures I've taken.
        Last but not least, I love bad (like <em>really bad</em>) movies.
